      <li>
        <strong>1973</strong> - His untimely death shocked the nation into a sense of collective guilt spread nationwide. This was because, prior to his death, he had been discredited and rejected by the entertainment industry and the public at large,
        who felt that he was a "has-been" and that his songs and films were no longer relevant or marketable. It is also revealed that, despite his previous success in the entertainment industry, P. Ramlee had died penniless, having given away the last
        of his money to a visitor to his house who he felt needed the money more than him.
